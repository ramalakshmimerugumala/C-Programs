## ðŸ”¹ Difference Between Microcontroller and Microprocessor

|  Feature              |  Microcontroller                            | Microprocessor                         |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Components             | CPU + RAM + ROM + I/O in one chip            | Only CPU (others are external)           |
| Memory                 | Less (built-in)                              | More (external RAM, storage)             |
| Operating System       | Usually no OS / small RTOS                   | Can run full OS (Windows/Linux)          |
| Speed                  | Slower                                       | Faster                                   |
| Power Consumption      | Low                                          | High                                     |
| Cost                   | Low                                          | High                                     |
| Applications           | Washing machine, Microwave, TV remote       | PC, Laptop, Game console                 |
| Best Feature           | All components integrated in one chip       | High performance & multitasking          |
| Used in                | Embedded systems                             | General-purpose systems                  |

## âœ… Summary:
- **Embedded System**: A specific-purpose mini-computer built around a microcontroller.
- **Microcontroller**: All-in-one chip for small embedded applications.
- **Microprocessor**: Only CPU; needs external parts.
- **SoC**: Entire computer system on a single chip.

  

## Day 2 â€“ System on Chip (SoC)
##  Definition:
A **System on Chip (SoC)** is an integrated chip that combines all the essential components of a computer system on a **single chip**.
It includes:
- CPU (like in microprocessors)
- Memory (RAM, ROM)
- I/O Ports (like in microcontrollers)
- Peripherals (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Timers, ADC, etc.)
 SoC is a **combination of the best features** of both **Microcontroller** and **Microprocessor**:
- Like a **Microcontroller**: It has all components integrated into one chip
- Like a **Microprocessor**: It supports high performance and multitasking
# IDEs Used for Microcontroller Programming
 What is an IDE?
**IDE** stands for **Integrated Development Environment**.  
It is a software that contains all the tools required to develop embedded software in one place.
## ðŸ”¹ Tools Included in an IDE:
1. **Text Editor** â€“ for writing code  
2. **Compiler** â€“ to convert code into machine language  
3. **Debugger** â€“ to find and fix errors  
4. **Loader / Linker** â€“ to combine files and prepare output
## ðŸ”¹ Popular IDEs for Microcontroller:
### 1. **Arduino IDE**
- Used for Arduino boards (UNO, Nano, Mega, etc.)
- Beginner-friendly
- Generates `.hex` files after compilation
- Easy uploading via USB

### 2. **Keil ÂµVision IDE**
- Used for 8051, ARM, and STM32 microcontrollers
- Used in professional and industrial environments
- Supports debugging, simulation, and memory configuration
- Generates `.hex` files for flashing into microcontrollers
## ðŸ”¹ What is a Hex File?
Once your embedded C program is compiled, it generates a **`.hex` file**, which is the actual machine code that is loaded into the microcontroller.

# Microprocessor
Microprocessor can not uses the arduino and keil.It will uses the full fledged os(Macos,Windows,linux)

# Soc's
Soc also uses full fledged os i.e.,EmbeddedLinux(or)Variants of linux
Example--Smart phone -android linux
         Samsung smart tvs-TizenosLinux
         LG -Webos Linux
         Router -Openwrt(Open wireless router)linux

## Day3 Development tools
1.Text Editor: C program is written by using text editor
2.Compiler- converts c statemnets into instruction
Instructions contains Opcode and operands
