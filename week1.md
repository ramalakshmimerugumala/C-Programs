# # Day 1 â€“ Introduction to Embedded Systems
##  What is an Embedded System?
An **Embedded System** is a microcontroller-based **hardware + software** system designed to perform **a specific function**.
software that running by the hardware is known as Firmware.
 ## Real-Life Examples for microcontroller:   ## Examples for microprocessor      ##Examples for soc's(System on chip)
- Washing Machine                              -CT Scanner                         -Tv Remote
- micro oven                                    Drones                             -SmartPhone
- Air purifiers                                 Pc's,laptops                       -Surveilance Camera
- Ac's                                          Servers
  Microprocessor,Microcontroller,Soc's they execute instructions(Machinelevel/Lowlevel)
## ðŸ”¹ What is a Microcontroller?
A **Microcontroller** is a compact integrated circuit that contains:
- CPU
- RAM
- ROM
- Timers
- I/O Ports
**It is used in embedded systems.**
### ðŸ”¸ Examples:
- 8051 Microcontroller
- ATmega328 (Arduino)
- PIC Microcontroller
- ARM Cortex-M series

## ðŸ”¹ What is a Microprocessor?
A **Microprocessor** is just the **CPU** (Central Processing Unit).  
It needs external memory, input/output, and timers.
It is used in general-purpose systems (like computers, laptops).
### ðŸ”¸ Examples:
- Intel 8085
- Intel i3, i5, i7
- AMD Ryzen 5
## ðŸ”¹ What is SoC (System on Chip)?
A **System on Chip (SoC)** is an **entire computer system on a single chip**, including:
- Processor
- Memory
- Peripherals
- Graphics
- Wireless communication (like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth)
Soc's is designed by combining some of the best features of microcontroller and some of the best features of microprocessor.
### ðŸ”¸ Examples:
- Qualcomm Snapdragon (in phones)
- Apple M1 Chip
- Raspberry Pi (uses SoC)
## ðŸ”¹ Difference Between Microcontroller and Microprocessor

|  Feature              |  Microcontroller                            | Microprocessor                         |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Components             | CPU + RAM + ROM + I/O in one chip            | Only CPU (others are external)           |
| Memory                 | Less (built-in)                              | More (external RAM, storage)             |
| Operating System       | Usually no OS / small RTOS                   | Can run full OS (Windows/Linux)          |
| Speed                  | Slower                                       | Faster                                   |
| Power Consumption      | Low                                          | High                                     |
| Cost                   | Low                                          | High                                     |
| Applications           | Washing machine, Microwave, TV remote       | PC, Laptop, Game console                 |
| Best Feature           | All components integrated in one chip       | High performance & multitasking          |
| Used in                | Embedded systems                             | General-purpose systems                  |
